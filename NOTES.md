I developed the state management system for ANSCER Robotics with the goal of producing a robust, scalable, and real-time solution that assures consistent and reliable state transitions, efficient data/log streaming, and effective error communication. Implementing WebSockets or MQTT for real-time updates, using event sources for detailed state history, and standardising error reporting with unambiguous codes and messages were all important considerations. Geolocation data, battery level, and task history were among the state model variables analysed to improve contextual knowledge. The system's design focusses on fault tolerance, automated recovery, and scalability via horizontal scaling and sharding. Security measures, such as encryption and access limits, were prioritised to safeguard sensitive information. Future integration with machine learning for predictive maintenance and anomaly detection was also envisioned to better optimise the platform.
